In general, pre-trained models refer to models where training has already occurred, and often have high, or even cutting-edge accuracy. Using pre-trained models avoids the need for large-scale data collection and long, costly training. Given knowledge of how to preprocess the inputs and handle the outputs of the network, you can plug these directly into your own app.

In OpenVINO™, Pre-Trained Models refer specifically to the Model Zoo, in which the Free Model Set contains pre-trained models already converted using the Model Optimizer. These models can be used directly with the Inference Engine.

Further Research
We’ll come back to the various pre-trained models available with the OpenVINO™ Toolkit shortly, but you can get a headstart by checking out the documentation here.
