OpenVINO: Open Visual Inferencing and Neural Network Optimization


The OpenVINO™ Toolkit’s name comes from “Open Visual Inferencing and Neural Network Optimization”. It is largely focused around optimizing neural network inference, and is open source.

It is developed by Intel®, and helps support fast inference across Intel® CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and Neural Compute Stick with a common API. OpenVINO™ can take models built with multiple different frameworks, like TensorFlow or Caffe, and use its Model Optimizer to optimize for inference. This optimized model can then be used with the Inference Engine, which helps speed inference on the related hardware. It also has a wide variety of Pre-Trained Models already put through Model Optimizer.

By optimizing for model speed and size, OpenVINO™ enables running at the edge. This does not mean an increase in inference accuracy - this needs to be done in training beforehand. The smaller, quicker models OpenVINO™ generates, along with the hardware optimizations it provides, are great for lower resource applications. For example, an IoT device does not have the benefit of multiple GPUs and unlimited memory space to run its apps.
