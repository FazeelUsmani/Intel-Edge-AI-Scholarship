Most of the Pre-Trained Models supplied by OpenVINO™ fall into either face detection, human detection, or vehicle-related detection. There is also a model around detecting text, and more!

Models in the Public Model Set must still be run through the Model Optimizer, but have their original models available for further training and fine-tuning. The Free Model Set are already converted to Intermediate Representation format, and do not have the original model available. These can be easily obtained with the Model Downloader tool provided in the files installed with OpenVINO™.

The SSD and MobileNet architectures we discussed previously are often the main part of the architecture used for many of these models.
