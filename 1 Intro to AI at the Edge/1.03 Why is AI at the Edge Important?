1) Network impacts
2) Latency considerations
3) Security concerns
4) Optimizations for local inference



Why is AI at the Edge Important?

Network communication can be expensive (bandwidth, power consumption, etc.) and sometimes impossible (think remote locations or during natural disasters)
Real-time processing is necessary for applications, like self-driving cars, that can't handle latency in making important decisions
Edge applications could be using personal data (like health data) that could be sensitive if sent to cloud
Optimization software, especially made for specific hardware, can help achieve great efficiency with edge AI models
