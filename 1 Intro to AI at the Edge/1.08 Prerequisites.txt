Summary
Prerequisites:
Understand some of the basics of computer vision and how AI models are created.
Basic Python or C++ experience. This first course is mainly in Python, although C++ can be used with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit easily as well (and can be faster in a completed app!).
We will not be training models in this course, as our focus is on optimization & deployment at the edge.
Classroom workspaces will be available for exercises, so no set-up required if you plan to use them.
Local Set-up
Make sure to make note of the hardware requirements for the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit if you want to work locally.
If you do want to do the exercises on your local machine (or perhaps even on a set-up like a Raspberry Pi with an Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2), you can follow the instructions here for your operating system.
Intel® DevCloud - Edge
There is also the new Intel® DevCloud platform for testing out edge environments. This allows you to have access to a range of Intel® hardware such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, Neural Compute Stick, and more. Later courses will get more into the hardware side of things, but this another option for working with an edge environment.
