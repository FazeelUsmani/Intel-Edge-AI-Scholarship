Per IntelÂ®, IoT growth has gone from 2 billion devices in 2006 to a projected 200 billion by 2020.
From the first network ATMs in the 1970's, to the World Wide Web in the 90's, and on up to smart meters in early 2000's, we've come a long way.
From the constant use devices like phones to smart speakers, smart refrigerators, locks, warehouse applications and more, the IoT pool keeps expanding.
