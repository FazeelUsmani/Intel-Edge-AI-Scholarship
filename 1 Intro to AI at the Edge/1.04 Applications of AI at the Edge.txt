There are nearly endless possibilities with the edge.
IoT devices are a big use of the edge.
Not every single app needs it - you can likely wait a second while your voice app goes to ask the server a question, or such as when NASA engineers are processing the latest black hole data.


Edge applications:-
1) Self Driving Cars
2) regular heartbeats for heart attacks
3) Robots that are used in surgery
4) Tracking animals such as Tiger or Lion which have high chances of poaching
